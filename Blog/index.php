<p>Welcome to Exedump, my hobby project.</p>
<br>
<p>I usually don't do much other than school and play games.</p>
<p>But on the offchance I actually do something.<br>It's likely you can find it at my <a href="https://github.com/mattias-viklund">Github</a>.</p>
<p>But if you're looking for something way deeper but also truly meaningless, head over to the <a href="blog/index.php">Blog</a> section, and take a peek.</p>
